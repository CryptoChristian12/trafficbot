# Trafficbot
This is a simple python script authored by me to demonstrate how easy it is to generate traffic for your website to improve your google ranking and do other black SEO . 

Using Tor Addon in your default browser is essential to make the clicks on links count. This way the IP address keeps changing with every new request , fooling the web server that these requests are from diffrent IP's . 

It is to be understood that this is no professional tool , but can be used to generate huge volumes of traffic for your blogs/website . 


HELP and SUPPORT

Add up as many URLs as you need for a single loop. Just keep adding the new line :

webbrowser.open_new_tab(url) time.sleep(wait_time)

time.sleep(wait_time) -> Makes sure your browser doesn't Crash . 

THE SCRIPT WILL OPEN THE SITE ON YOUR WEBBROWSER, DON'T GO TOO CRAZY.

Make sure you run a Proxy on your browser otherwise maybe the Analystics dont consider clicks in Counts . 

I just quickly updated the project a bit since I trought it had much more potential, I'll update it further later, probaly with requests and more management.
